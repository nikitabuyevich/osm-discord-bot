If you vote every day, you will keep increasing your vote streak and thus increase the total amount of Maple Cash you obtain from voting! If you miss a day however, your vote streak will reset down to 0!')

Otherwise the max character count of a nickname is 32). Simply right click on the OSM Discord server and choose "Change Nickname" and set it to **!IGN** (e.g., !Kyanite) where IGN is the IGN you would like to appear as. It\'s that simple!')

If you are generous and have spare income, we would really appreciate a donation to help operate the server and pay bills. Every little bit helps!')
